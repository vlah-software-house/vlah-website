## Overview

The existing website was outdated, slow, and difficult to use, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of customers.

Wheelie Bin Storage hired us to develop a new WordPress theme to revamp the website, providing a modern and user-friendly interface.

### The Results

 - 20% increase in online sales within the first three months
 - Easier for the company to update and manage website content

**Key Takeaway**: Investing in a new, well-designed WordPress theme helped Wheelie Bin Storage enhance their online presence, provide a better user experience, and boost sales and customer engagement.
